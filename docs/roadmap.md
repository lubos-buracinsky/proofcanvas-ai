## Deal Intelligence Engine for Early-Stage Investors

Upgrade your due diligence with structured risk extraction, 72h validation design, and evidence-weighted scoring.

**We decompose startup risk into a standardized hypothesis ledger and deliver actionable investment insight in under 5 days.**

## The Problem

Early-stage investing is still largely intuition-driven.

- Risk is described, not decomposed.
- Hypotheses are implied, not ledgered.
- Validation is discussed, not structured.
- AI claims are accepted without economic scrutiny.
- Portfolio learning is not systematized.

There is no standardized risk infrastructure for early-stage capital.

## The Opportunity

What credit scoring did for lending, structured risk intelligence can do for venture.

ProofCanvas introduces:

- A **standardized risk ontology**
- A **hypothesis ledger**
- A **72h validation discipline**
- An **AI Lever economic test**
- An **Expansion Trigger checkpoint**
- A structured **ProofScore**

We make early-stage investing more probabilistic.

# What We Deliver (Pilot Format – Live Now)

For a single startup deal:

### 1. Structured Risk Decomposition
We extract and map:
- Demand Risk
- Monetization Risk
- Distribution Risk
- Execution Risk
- AI Fragility Risk
- Regulatory Risk

### 2. Hypothesis Ledger
All implicit claims become explicit, testable statements.

### 3. 72h Validation Sprint Design
Concrete experiment blueprint:
- Asset to build
- Traffic source
- Signal threshold
- Decision trigger

### 4. AI Lever Analysis
Where AI meaningfully changes unit economics:
- Cost collapse?
- Speed multiplier?
- Labor displacement?
- Data moat potential?

Or is it cosmetic?

### 5. Expansion Trigger Mapping
What must be true for:
- New segment expansion
- New geography rollout
- Replicable scaling

### 6. Evidence Gap Index
Quantifies how much of the model is assumed vs. validated.

### 7. Investment Memo (VC-Ready)
Delivered as a structured internal memo.

# Pilot Structure (Concierge Layer)

This is currently delivered as a high-touch Deal Intelligence Sprint.

- Deck ingestion
- Structured extraction
- Risk scoring session
- 72h experiment design
- Written Risk Memo

Turnaround: 5 business days  
Pilot Price: Custom (Limited early cohort)

This is the first iteration of the ProofCanvas Engine.

---

# Who This Is For

- Early-stage VCs (Pre-seed, Seed)
- Venture Studios
- Angel Syndicates
- Corporate Venture Arms

If you evaluate 5–15 early-stage deals per month, this system compounds.

# Future Product Vision

ProofCanvas is evolving into:

- VC Integration API
- Portfolio Risk Dashboard
- Cross-fund Risk Benchmark Index
- Hypothesis Velocity Tracker
- ProofScore Standard

Our ambition:
To become the risk infrastructure layer for early-stage capital.

# Case Study Zero: Building ProofCanvas on Itself

We applied ProofCanvas to our own thesis.

### Hypothesis
VCs lack structured risk decomposition and pay for improved diligence quality.

### Risks Identified
- Demand Risk: Are VCs willing to formalize intuition?
- Pricing Risk: Will funds pay for external intelligence?
- Adoption Friction: Political resistance to scoring?

### 72h Test
- Direct outreach to 20 VC partners
- Offer structured risk teardown of one recent investment
- Measure booked calls + WTP conversations

### AI Lever
Automation of hypothesis extraction at scale.

### Expansion Trigger
- 3 paying VC clients
- 50 analyzed deals dataset

This project is its own first live validation experiment.

# Why Now

AI has dramatically lowered:
- Information extraction cost
- Analysis latency
- Simulation speed

What used to require analyst teams can now be structured and accelerated.

The capital allocation layer is overdue for modernization.

# Short VC Pitch Version (You Can Paste in Email)

Subject: Structured Risk Intelligence for Your Next Deal

I built ProofCanvas — a Deal Intelligence Engine that decomposes early-stage startup risk into a standardized hypothesis ledger and delivers a structured risk memo + 72h validation blueprint.

I’m offering to analyze one of your recent investments or live deals as a pilot.

Turnaround: 5 days.  
Output: Risk heatmap, Evidence Gap Index, 72h validation plan.

If useful, we discuss subscription.

Open to a 20-minute intro this week?
